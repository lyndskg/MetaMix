# MetaMix

MetaMix is a coding project that aims to create a virtual taskrabbit for updating the metadata of audio tracks (e.g., .mp3, .wav) on mixing software platforms such as Serato or RekordBox. The project will use the file names, which may be pulled from sources like YouTube and already contain the artist and song title, to automatically populate and organize the metadata fields, including track name, artist, album, genre, and more. This automation will save time and effort for DJs and music enthusiasts who want to manage their music library efficiently.

Python would be a suitable coding language for this project due to its extensive libraries for audio processing and metadata manipulation.

Basic Workflow:
1. File Name Parsing: The program will start by analyzing the file names of the audio tracks to extract relevant information, such as the artist name and song title.
2. Metadata Updating: Using the extracted information, the program will automatically update the metadata fields of each audio track. This includes setting the track name, artist, album, genre, release year, and any other relevant information.
3. User Input and Validation: The project can offer a user-friendly interface for users to review and validate the proposed metadata updates. In case of any errors or discrepancies, users can make corrections manually.
4. Batch Processing: MetaMix will support batch processing to update metadata for multiple audio tracks simultaneously, streamlining the organization of large music libraries.
5. Integration with Mixing Software: Once the metadata updates are finalized, the program will integrate with mixing software such as Serato or RekordBox, ensuring that the updated information is reflected in the user's music library within the mixing software.


Basic I/O Details:
1. Input: Audio files in formats like .mp3 or .wav.
- File names of the audio tracks (potentially pulled from sources like YouTube).
2. Output: Updated metadata for each audio track, including track name, artist, album, genre, etc.
- Confirmation of successful metadata updates.
- Error reports for any files with invalid or incomplete information.

Project Goals and Advantages:
1. Efficiency: MetaMix aims to automate the tedious process of updating metadata for audio tracks, saving users valuable time and effort.
2. Accuracy: By using reliable information from the file names (extracted from sources like YouTube), the project ensures accurate metadata updates.
3. Seamless Integration: The program will seamlessly integrate with popular mixing software platforms, making it a valuable tool for DJs and music enthusiasts.
4. Batch Processing: Supporting batch processing allows users to update metadata for multiple tracks at once, further enhancing efficiency.

MetaMix will become a valuable companion for DJs and music collectors, simplifying the organization and management of their music libraries with accurate and up-to-date metadata.
